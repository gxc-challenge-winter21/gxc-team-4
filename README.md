## About #reCyclers

Welcome to the repository of #reCyclers, the service which integrates folding bikes into existing modes of transportation within the B2B world.
We are six students from the US and Germany and have teamed up to solve the challenge of *"How might we effectively integrate folding-bikes-systems and rail usage in urban and rural areas?"* given to us by [DB Connect](https://www.deutschebahnconnect.com/en) within the context of the [GXC Innovation Challenge](https://www.hm.edu/en/international/projects_1/gxc/gxc_virtual_innovation_challenge.en.html).
During the entire process of this project the aspects of health, affordability and environment were taken into account to create a viable solution for the customer.
