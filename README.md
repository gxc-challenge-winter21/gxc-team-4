## About #reCyclers

Welcome to the repository of #reCyclers, the service which integrates folding bikes into existing modes of transportation within the B2B world.
We are six students from the US and Germany and have teamed up to solve the challenge of *"How might we effectively integrate folding-bikes-systems and rail usage in urban and rural areas?"* given to us by [DB Connect](https://www.deutschebahnconnect.com/en) within the context of the [GXC Innovation Challenge](https://www.hm.edu/en/international/projects_1/gxc/gxc_virtual_innovation_challenge.en.html).
During the entire process of this project the aspects of health, affordability and environment were taken into account to create a viable solution for the customer.

## A solution for commuters

In order to to bring innovation and convenience to our customers the services comes with the app #reCyclers. This allows the end user to book bikes, plan trips and redeem their reward points in the integrated DB shops. This app was already designed and given to users for the first feedback to ensure high quality and usability of the design, this can be seen in more detail in our wiki on the [prototype site](https://github.com/gxc-challenge-winter21/gxc-team-4/wiki/Prototyping-Sprint-2).
